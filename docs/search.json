    "text": "Biography\nI am a Doctoral Student in Bioinformatics in the Izzi Group since April 2021.\nI completed my Bachelors’ degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Florence, Italy. During my stay in Florence, I interned at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies of the National Council of Research in Florence for my thesis and worked on understanding the diversity and phylogeny of Nostoc cf communales(cyanobacteria) from Greenland. My internship gave me the first insight into the world of computational biology, it ensnared my curiosity and propelled me to go on and get my Masters’ degree in Bioinformatics from the University of Bologna, Italy. I carried out at my Masters’ thesis work as an Erasmus scholar at the University of Ghent, Belgium. During my Masters’, I found myself enchanted by the world of Systems and In-Silico Biology and the entire framework of Machine Learning. I fell in love with this mathematical framework to understand biological systems, that allows us to decode seemingly intractable biological mysteries and I am particularly interested in using this framework for modelling the biology of disease, more specifically, cancer.\nCurrently, I am exploring the matrisome-cancer interface to understand the role that matrisome mutations may play in defining the landscape of the Tumor Microenvironment using a wide variety of computational methods."

    "text": "Decoding the Tumor-ECM Dialogue\nAt the Izzi Lab, our central mission is to understand how tumors communicate with their surrounding environment, the extracellular matrix (ECM). This dynamic dialogue is critical for cancer growth, metastasis, and treatment resistance. We build and apply cutting-edge computational models to listen in on this conversation, aiming to identify novel therapeutic strategies that can disrupt it.\nOur research is built on three interconnected pillars:\n\n1. Mapping the Tumor-ECM Ecosystem\nBefore we can intervene, we must first create a detailed map of the territory. We use multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to build comprehensive models of the tumor microenvironment. Our goal is to uncover the fundamental rules governing how the matrisome—the full collection of ECM proteins—is constructed and remodeled during cancer progression.\n\nMatrisome Profiling: Characterizing the unique ECM signatures of different cancer types and subtypes.\nCell-Matrix Communication: Identifying the signaling pathways that cells use to sense and respond to their ECM.\nSpatial & Single-Cell Analysis: Understanding how tumor-ECM interactions vary in space and across individual cells to drive heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n2. Building Novel Computational & AI Tools\nStandard bioinformatics tools are often insufficient to capture the complexity of the ECM. A core part of our mission is to develop the next generation of software for the research community. We integrate network biology, statistical modeling, and machine learning to create robust, open-source tools that turn raw data into biological insight.\n\nPredictive Modeling: Using AI and deep learning to predict patient outcomes or treatment responses based on ECM signatures.\nAlgorithm Development: Designing novel graph-based algorithms inspired by complex systems to find key vulnerabilities in the tumor-ECM network.\nFlagship Software: Developing and maintaining user-friendly R packages like MatrisomeAnalyzeR and MatriCom for widespread use.\n\n\n\n3. Driving Translational Impact & Open Science\nOur ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes. We bridge the gap between computational discovery and clinical application by working closely with oncologists and experimental biologists. By identifying network-based biomarkers and potential drug targets, we aim to contribute directly to the future of cancer therapy.\n\nTherapeutic Target Identification: Pinpointing specific ECM components or regulators that are critical for tumor survival.\nBiomarker Discovery: Finding matrisome signatures that can predict metastasis or drug resistance.\nOpen & Reproducible Science: We are committed to open science, ensuring our code, data, and pipelines are publicly available to accelerate research for everyone."
