Valerio and Ayomide attended the ASMB 2025 Biennial Meeting (November 16-19, 2025) in Baltimore, MD. It was a great opportunity to share our latest work on spatial transcriptomics and connect with the ECM research community. We also met our friends from the Naba Lab!

**Izzi, V.** (2025). GENESIS: rapid generation of superresolution tissue maps from spatial transcriptomics data. Talk presented at the ASMB 2025 Biennial Meeting.
