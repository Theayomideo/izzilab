## Abstract

This study systematically analyzes post-translational modification-disrupting mutations in the tumor matrisome across cancer types. We reveal how PTM alterations in ECM proteins contribute to cancer progression.

## Key Findings

- Identified recurrent PTM-disrupting mutations in matrisome genes
- Characterized functional consequences of PTM disruption
- Revealed cancer type-specific PTM mutation patterns
- Demonstrated impact on ECM structure and tumor behavior

## Significance

PTM-disrupting mutations represent an underappreciated mechanism of ECM dysfunction in cancer, with implications for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting.
