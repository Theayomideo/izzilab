## Abstract

This study demonstrates that genetic ablation of transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H-TM) reduces atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice. We reveal a novel role for P4H-TM in vascular disease pathogenesis.

## Key Findings

- P4H-TM deletion reduces atherosclerotic plaque burden
- Altered ECM composition in vessel walls of knockout mice
- Identified P4H-TM-dependent inflammatory pathways
- Demonstrated therapeutic potential of P4H-TM inhibition

## Therapeutic Implications

Our findings suggest that targeting P4H-TM could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases.
