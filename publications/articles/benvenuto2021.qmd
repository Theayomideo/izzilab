## Abstract

This review examines tumor antigen heterogeneity in breast cancer and strategies for targeting neoantigens. We discuss the role of the ECM in modulating immune responses and implications for immunotherapy development.

## Key Topics

- Neoantigen generation and presentation in breast cancer
- ECM influence on tumor-immune interactions
- Strategies for neoantigen-based immunotherapy
- Overcoming immune evasion mechanisms

## Therapeutic Perspectives

Understanding the interplay between tumor antigens, ECM, and immune responses is crucial for developing effective breast cancer immunotherapies.
