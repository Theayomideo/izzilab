## Abstract

This review explores the emerging roles of MACIT (membrane-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) and multiplexin collagens in stem cell biology and cancer. We discuss how these specialized collagens regulate cell fate decisions and tumor progression.

## Key Topics

- Structure and function of MACIT and multiplexin collagens
- Roles in stem cell niche maintenance
- Impact on cancer stem cells and metastasis
- Therapeutic targeting opportunities

## Future Directions

Understanding MACIT and multiplexin collagen functions opens new avenues for regenerative medicine and cancer therapy development.
