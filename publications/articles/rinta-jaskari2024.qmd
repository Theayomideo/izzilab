## Abstract

This study demonstrates the critical role of collagen XVIII in maintaining ECM integrity during nephron development. We show how collagen XVIII deficiency affects nephron progenitor cell behavior and kidney morphogenesis.

## Key Findings

- Collagen XVIII is essential for proper nephron ECM organization
- Loss of collagen XVIII disrupts nephron progenitor cell niche
- Identified molecular mechanisms linking collagen XVIII to progenitor cell maintenance
- Revealed impact on adult kidney function and disease susceptibility

## Developmental Significance

Our findings highlight the importance of specific ECM components in organ development and provide insights into congenital kidney disease mechanisms.
