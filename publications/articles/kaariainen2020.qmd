## Abstract

Using machine learning approaches, we identify robust matrisome markers and their regulatory mechanisms across cancer types. This computational framework reveals previously unrecognized ECM patterns associated with clinical outcomes.

## Key Findings

- Developed machine learning pipeline for matrisome analysis
- Identified pan-cancer and cancer-specific ECM markers
- Revealed regulatory networks controlling matrisome expression
- Validated markers in independent patient cohorts

## Computational Innovation

Our machine learning framework provides a powerful tool for discovering clinically relevant matrisome patterns and understanding ECM regulation in cancer.
