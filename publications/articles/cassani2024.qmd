## Abstract

Using patient-derived prostate cancer tumoroids, we demonstrate how TGF-β signaling drives pathological matrisome alterations and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study provides insights into tumor microenvironment remodeling in prostate cancer progression.

## Key Findings

- TGF-β induces comprehensive matrisome remodeling in 3D tumoroids
- Identified key ECM proteins driving EMT in prostate cancer
- Characterized temporal dynamics of ECM changes during tumor progression
- Revealed therapeutic targets within the tumor matrisome

## Translational Relevance

Our findings suggest that targeting TGF-β-induced matrisome alterations could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for aggressive prostate cancer.
