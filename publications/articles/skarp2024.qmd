## Abstract

This study identifies novel genetic variants associated with primary myocardial fibrosis in victims of sudden cardiac death. Through comprehensive genetic analysis, we reveal key ECM-related genetic factors contributing to cardiac fibrosis and sudden death risk.

## Key Findings

- Identified multiple novel genetic variants linked to myocardial fibrosis
- Discovered associations between ECM gene mutations and sudden cardiac death
- Characterized fibrotic patterns in genetically stratified patient cohorts
- Provided insights for genetic screening and risk assessment

## Clinical Implications

These findings have important implications for genetic screening programs and risk stratification in individuals with family history of sudden cardiac death.
