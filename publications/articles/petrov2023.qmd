## Abstract

The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays crucial roles in development, homeostasis, and disease. We present MatrisomeAnalyzeR, a comprehensive suite of tools for annotating and quantifying ECM molecules across different organisms and large-scale datasets.

## Software Features

- **Annotation:** Automatic identification of matrisome components
- **Quantification:** Statistical analysis of ECM abundance
- **Visualization:** Novel chart types including 'matrirings', 'matristars', and 'matriflows'
- **Cross-species:** Support for human, mouse, and other model organisms

## Availability

MatrisomeAnalyzeR is freely available as an R package with accompanying web interface.
