## Abstract

The extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes extensive remodeling during cancer progression. We present MatriNet, a comprehensive database that captures ECM network dynamics across multiple cancer types. Our analysis reveals distinct ECM signatures associated with tumor progression and metastasis.

## Key Findings

- Identified over 25,000 curated ECM interactions
- Discovered 210 statistically robust matrisome markers for 74 tumor subtypes
- Demonstrated dynamic ECM remodeling patterns during cancer progression
- Validated findings in independent cohorts

## Database Access

The MatriNet database is available for research use. Contact the authors for access.
