## Abstract

MatriNet is a comprehensive database designed to capture and analyze extracellular matrix network dynamics in cancer. This resource provides researchers with tools to explore ECM remodeling patterns across multiple cancer types and stages.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive ECM interaction network data
- Cancer type-specific ECM signatures
- Temporal dynamics of ECM remodeling
- Integration with clinical outcome data

## Database Access

MatriNet is freely available for academic research at [database URL]. The resource includes tutorials and analysis tools for exploring ECM networks in cancer.
