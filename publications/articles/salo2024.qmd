## Abstract

This study reveals distinct sequence specificities of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase isoenzymes I and II towards X-Pro-Gly triplets. These findings provide new insights into collagen post-translational modification and its regulation.

## Key Findings

- Demonstrated differential substrate preferences between P4H isoenzymes
- Identified specific X-Pro-Gly sequences targeted by each isoenzyme
- Revealed impact on collagen stability and function
- Characterized enzymatic kinetics and structural basis for specificity

## Biochemical Significance

Understanding isoenzyme-specific hydroxylation patterns is crucial for comprehending collagen maturation, stability, and tissue-specific ECM properties.
