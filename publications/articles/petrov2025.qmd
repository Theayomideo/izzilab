## Abstract

ProToDeviseR is an automated tool for generating protein topology schemes from structural data. This software addresses the need for rapid and accurate visualization of protein domain organization and topology.

## Key Findings

- Automated generation of protein topology diagrams from PDB structures
- Supports multiple input formats and customizable output options
- Accurately identifies and visualizes secondary structure elements
- Significantly reduces time required for topology scheme generation

## Software Availability

ProToDeviseR is open-source software available under the MIT license. The source code and documentation are available at the corresponding GitHub repository.
