## Abstract

This study reveals the pro-tumorigenic role of integrin α11 in the stroma of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We demonstrate how stromal integrin α11 upregulation promotes skin carcinogenesis through ECM remodeling and fibroblast activation.

## Key Findings

- Integrin α11 is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts
- Stromal integrin α11 promotes tumor growth and invasion
- Identified downstream signaling pathways mediating pro-tumorigenic effects
- Demonstrated therapeutic potential of targeting stromal integrin α11

## Therapeutic Implications

Our findings suggest that targeting stromal integrin α11 could represent a novel therapeutic approach for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
