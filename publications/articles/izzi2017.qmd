## Abstract

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is often overlooked in hematological malignancies. We identified a specific ECM gene expression signature in leukemia precursor cells and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with prognostic implications.

## Key Findings

- Discovered distinct ECM expression patterns in AML patient samples
- Identified ECM signature with favorable prognostic value
- Patients with higher ECM signature expression showed longer relapse-free survival
- Validated findings in independent AML cohorts

## Clinical Significance

This work demonstrates that ECM signatures can serve as prognostic biomarkers in AML, suggesting potential therapeutic targets in the leukemic microenvironment.

## Data Availability

Expression data and signatures are available in the supplementary materials and upon request.
