## Abstract

This comprehensive review examines the multifaceted roles of tenascin-C in cancer progression. We discuss recent advances in understanding tenascin-C functions in tumor microenvironment remodeling, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance.

## Key Topics

- Tenascin-C structure and isoform diversity
- Roles in tumor angiogenesis and immune evasion
- Impact on cancer stem cell niches
- Therapeutic targeting strategies

## Clinical Relevance

Tenascin-C represents a promising therapeutic target and biomarker for various cancer types, with multiple targeting strategies currently under development.
