## Abstract

3DMOUSEneST represents a novel volumetric imaging approach for studying embryo-uterine interactions without the need for labeling. This method provides unprecedented insights into decidualization processes and implantation dynamics.

## Key Findings

- Developed label-free 3D imaging method for embryo-uterine interface
- Enables real-time monitoring of decidualization processes
- Reveals spatiotemporal dynamics of ECM remodeling during implantation
- Provides quantitative metrics for implantation efficacy assessment

## Technical Innovation

This imaging platform combines optical clearing techniques with advanced microscopy to achieve deep tissue imaging while preserving native tissue architecture and ECM organization.
