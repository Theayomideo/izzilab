## Abstract

We present MatriCom, a computational tool designed to mine single-cell RNA sequencing data to identify and analyze cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. This tool enables researchers to systematically explore ECM-ECM and cell-ECM communication systems at single-cell resolution.

## Key Findings

- Developed a comprehensive scRNA-seq data mining framework for ECM interaction analysis
- Enables identification of cell-specific ECM communication networks
- Provides insights into ECM remodeling at single-cell resolution
- Validated across multiple tissue types and disease models

## Software Availability

MatriCom is freely available for academic use. The tool can be accessed through the corresponding author's repository.
