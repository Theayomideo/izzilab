## Abstract

We developed fibroblast-derived matrix models that recapitulate desmoplastic properties of tumor stroma. Analysis of these matrices revealed a distinct ECM signature that serves as a prognostic indicator for cancer progression.

## Key Findings

- Created physiologically relevant fibroblast-derived matrix models
- Identified ECM signature predictive of patient outcomes
- Characterized mechanical and biochemical properties of desmoplastic matrices
- Demonstrated impact on tumor cell behavior and drug response

## Prognostic Value

The identified ECM signature provides a robust prognostic tool for stratifying cancer patients and predicting treatment response.
