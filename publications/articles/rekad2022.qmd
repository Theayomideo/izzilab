## Abstract

This review explores the "alternative matrisome" - the collection of ECM protein isoforms generated through alternative splicing. We discuss how alternative splicing contributes to ECM diversity and its implications for tissue homeostasis and disease.

## Key Topics

- Mechanisms of ECM protein alternative splicing
- Tissue-specific and developmental regulation
- Role in cancer progression and metastasis
- Therapeutic targeting of splice variants

## Biological Significance

Alternative splicing dramatically expands ECM functional diversity, providing tissue-specific properties and disease-associated alterations that represent novel therapeutic targets.
