## Abstract

This comprehensive pan-cancer analysis reveals the landscape of genomic alterations and mutations affecting the matrisome. We identify recurrent patterns of ECM dysregulation across tumor types and their clinical significance.

## Key Findings

- Systematic characterization of matrisome mutations across 33 cancer types
- Identified driver mutations in ECM genes
- Revealed convergent and divergent patterns of ECM alterations
- Correlated genomic changes with patient survival

## Clinical Relevance

Our findings provide a resource for understanding ECM-driven oncogenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets within the tumor matrisome.
