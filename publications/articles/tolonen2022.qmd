## Abstract

This study demonstrates that compound mutations in collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunits P4ha1 and P4ha2 lead to reduced bone mass in mice. We reveal the critical role of collagen hydroxylation in maintaining bone homeostasis.

## Key Findings

- Compound P4ha1+/−; P4ha2−/− mice exhibit significant bone loss
- Reduced collagen hydroxylation affects bone matrix quality
- Altered osteoblast and osteoclast activity in mutant mice
- Identified compensatory mechanisms in collagen synthesis

## Clinical Relevance

These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of bone disorders associated with collagen post-translational modification defects.
