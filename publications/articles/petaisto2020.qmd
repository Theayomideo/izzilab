## Abstract

This study demonstrates that collagen XVIII deficiency causes lipodystrophy and disrupts hepatic metabolic homeostasis. We reveal unexpected metabolic functions of this basement membrane component.

## Key Findings

- Collagen XVIII knockout mice develop lipodystrophy
- Altered hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism
- Disrupted adipose tissue ECM organization
- Identified collagen XVIII-dependent metabolic pathways

## Metabolic Implications

Our findings establish collagen XVIII as a critical regulator of metabolic homeostasis, with implications for understanding metabolic disorders.
