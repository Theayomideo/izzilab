## Abstract

This study demonstrates that targeting collagen XVIII enhances the therapeutic efficacy of ErbB inhibitors in breast cancer. We reveal a novel mechanism of drug resistance mediated by collagen XVIII-dependent signaling.

## Key Findings

- Collagen XVIII expression correlates with ErbB inhibitor resistance
- Targeting collagen XVIII sensitizes tumors to ErbB inhibition
- Identified molecular mechanisms linking collagen XVIII to drug resistance
- Validated combination therapy approach in preclinical models

## Clinical Implications

Our findings support the development of combination therapies targeting both collagen XVIII and ErbB signaling for improved breast cancer treatment outcomes.
