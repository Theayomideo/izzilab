## Abstract

This population-based study estimates the prevalence of pathogenic variants in COL4A3-COL4A5 genes and their implications for Alport syndrome. We provide crucial epidemiological data for genetic counseling and screening strategies.

## Key Findings

- Identified higher than expected prevalence of pathogenic variants
- Characterized variant distribution across populations
- Revealed implications for Alport syndrome diagnosis
- Provided refined prevalence estimates for genetic counseling

## Clinical Impact

These findings suggest that Alport syndrome and related disorders may be more common than previously recognized, with important implications for screening and early intervention.
