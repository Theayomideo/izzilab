## Biography

Valerio Izzi is an Associate Professor of Bioinformatics at the University of Oulu, Finland. He leads the Izzi Group on Bioinformatics and Data Analysis within the Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine. His research focuses on understanding the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) production in cancer and its effects on the tumor microenvironment, hematopoiesis, and immunity.

Dr. Izzi established his independent research group in 2020 after being tenured in the Profi-5 call at the University of Oulu. His lab has become internationally recognized for developing computational tools and databases for matrisome analysis.

## Research Focus

-   **Extracellular Matrix in Cancer** - Understanding ECM dynamics in tumor development and metastasis
-   **Tumor Microenvironment** - Computational analysis of tumor-stroma interactions
-   **Cancer Bioinformatics** - Developing algorithms for studying molecular networks in cancer
-   **Machine Learning in Omics** - Applying AI techniques to single cell and spatial omics analysis
